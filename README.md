# USACO Training Problems

Problem statements can be found at train.usaco.org (registration required).

These solutions are written in python 3 (now supported by the training grader) with readability in mind. I've made comments at tricky places, especially where I was tripped up. 

Python makes a lot of these solutions really short and clean. You might notice a change in coding styles as I worked through the problems and picked up more python tricks and idioms.
