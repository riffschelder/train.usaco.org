# Solutions to USACO Training Problems

Problem statements can be found at train.usaco.org (registration required).

These solutions are written in python 3 (now supported by the training grader) with readability in mind. I've made comments at tricky places, especially where I was tripped up. 

Python makes a lot of these solutions really short and clean. You might notice a change in my coding style as I progressed through the problems and picked up more python tricks and idioms along the way.

The .in and .out files contain the last test case I used to test my solution to each problem. For easy problems, they might be the sample input/output. For more complicated problems, it's likely a test case that revealed a bug I had to fix.
