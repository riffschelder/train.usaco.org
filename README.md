# USACO Training Problems

Problem statements can be found at train.usaco.org (registration required).

These solutions are written in python 3 (now supported by the training grader).

As I worked through the problems, I've written comments at places where I was tripped up. Variables are meaningfully named as much as possible. In my opinion, these solutions are a lot more readable than the ones presented in the post-solve analyses (even when the algorithm is the same).

Some of the file I/O code, especially in the earlier sections, aren't as clean as they can be. As I progress through the problems, I'm also picking up on new python idioms. I won't be cleaning up earlier solutions.

I've noticed that I don't close input files consistently. Files are closed when the program exits anyway, but sometimes I make it a point to close the input file when I want to remind myself all information has been parsed in. I won't be cleaning these up either.
